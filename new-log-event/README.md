# New Log Event

PowerShell script for generating custom Windows Event Log entries with specified sizes. Useful for testing log ingestion, validating Splunk Windows event collection, and creating controlled test data.

## Purpose

Create Windows event log entries of specific sizes to:

- Test Splunk Universal Forwarder event collection
- Validate event size limits and handling
- Generate test data for Windows event dashboards
- Troubleshoot event ingestion pipelines

## Disclaimer

Scripts are for troubleshooting purposes only and do not make any changes to a customer environment outside of writing output to a log file or generate test data (test data must follow guidelines of rule 2).

If a script generates test data, it must not include customer data, and it is expressly meant for lab testing. If test data needs to be generated within the customers environment, written permission from the customer on the case is required. README files for data generation scripts must explicitly state customer permission requirements.

**This script generates test data. Customer permission is required before running in a customer environment.**

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- PowerShell 3.0 or higher
- **Administrator privileges required** (script checks and exits if not running as admin)

## Usage

```powershell
.\New-LogEvent.ps1 -Size <characters> -Path <log_name>
```

### Parameters

- `-Size` - Required. Number of characters in event message (1-32000)
- `-Path` - Required. Windows event log name (e.g., Application, System)
- `-Source` - Optional. Event source name (default: CustomEventSource)

### Examples

```powershell
# Create 8KB event in Application log
.\New-LogEvent.ps1 -Size 8000 -Path Application

# Create 1KB event in System log
.\New-LogEvent.ps1 -Size 1024 -Path System

# Create event with custom source
.\New-LogEvent.ps1 -Size 5000 -Path Application -Source MySplunkTest
```

## Output

Script creates an Information-level event (Event ID 1001) with:

- Base message: "This is a test event generated by Write-CustomEventLog."
- Padding: 'X' characters to reach specified size
- Confirmation message showing actual size written

### Example Output

```
Event written to Application with size 8000 characters
```

## Notes

- **Always requires Administrator privileges** - script validates elevation before running
- **Cannot write to Windows Security logs** - security limitation built into the cmdlet
- Creating new event sources requires admin rights (one-time per source name)
- Events appear in Windows Event Viewer under specified log
- Script uses Event ID 1001 for all generated events
- Useful for testing Splunk's Windows event input configuration
- Maximum event size: 32000 characters (Windows limitation)
- Uses `throw` for proper PowerShell error handling (catchable by calling code)
